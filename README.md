# The Word Guessing Game

This project was created using React, SASS, and TypeScript

## Project Goals

- Create a game where people can guess the the hidden word
- Practice and learn more TypeScript
- Break components into separate files and keep code structured/organized
- Continue to improve CSS skills by using classnames, css modules
- Keep accessibility in mind
- Responsive and a variety of screen sizes

### Project Information

This project is another game-like application in which anyone can play by guessing the hidden word. The game allows you to spell 
out the word in the input box or click on buttons representing the alphabet which will either reveal the character or give you a strike.
The game allows you to first select a category and has the option of going back to the category select screen if you want to change the 
category. This project had a lot of JavaScript code due to the number of interactions possible.

Adding words and new categories is fairly straightforward with how the components are setup. It ensures future updates are feasible.

### Lessons Learned

I think the biggest lesson I learned here was to use a state management tool in the future like Context API or Redux due to how each
component can change the state.

I did struggle at the start with TypeScript but got more familiar with it as the project went on. I've decided to continue to use
TypeScript in any future project as it's quite helpful and widely used.

Another thing I realized was the styling could do with some improvement. There are very few icons/images so it's something I'll be keeping
in mind for future projects.

Overall the goals of the project were met and I'm glad to say I learned a lot with this project.
